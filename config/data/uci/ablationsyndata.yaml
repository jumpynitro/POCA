# @package _global_

# Number per class:
# - Before split: [12332  6688] [0.65 0.35]
# - Non-test after split: [8608 4706] [0.65 0.35]
# - Test after split: [3724 1982] [0.65 0.35]

# From docs:
# - Class 0 (gamma) is overrepresented in the data
# - Class 1 (hadron) would consistute the majority in reality

# Label counts:
# - Assume 75% of the test set is class 1
# - Set label_counts.target and label_counts.test based on this assumption
# - Set label_counts.pool and label_counts.val to match the before-split class distribution
# - Set label_counts.val to sum to 60, 20% of the training-label budget
